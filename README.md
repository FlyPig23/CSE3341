# CSE3341
Design a "Core language" based on Java

To run the Core Tokenizer:
1. Download and unzip the project folder
2. From the command line, cd into unzipped project folder
3. Run this command:
    python CoreTokenizerMain.py <filename>
    where <filename> is the input file to be tokenized. This must be a .txt file, and it must be either an absolute filepath if not in 
    the current project folder, or just a filename if it is inside the project folder.
